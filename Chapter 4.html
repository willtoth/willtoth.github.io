<H1>The Dawn of the Tiberium Age</H1><h2><a name="neworg"></a>A New Organization</h2>

<p>After the defeat of the Soviets at the end of Great World War II, the Allies reported to the United Nations about their gruesome battle against the Soviet Union. The UN then started a several years lasting review of all the information gathered from the war. When this review was eventually completed, the delegates of the UN would begin the formation of a Peace Corps capable of covertly dealing with anything from minor ethnic unrest and small terrorist factions to a situation involving a state of worldwide emergency as defined in the UN review of The Great World War II. Throughout the process, none of this was ever made known to the public in an attempt to prevent hostile infiltration of the Peace Corps as well as to circumvent certain UN declarations regarding restrictions in military affairs that were officially enforced at the time.</p>

<p>The UN continued to review many pages of documents, diaries, taped conversations and retrieved items from the Soviets in a bid to incorporate the gathered intelligence in the organizational structure of the new Peace Corps to further increase its military potential and overall efficiency. Eventually, this new and secretive peace keeping force became the best equipped and most efficient military organization on Earth, utilizing state-of-the-art high tech weaponry and equipment derived of both former Allied as well as Soviet designs.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the 1950'ies, the UN came to a solution on how to correctly finance the secret group. A proposal submitted to all the nations within the UN-pact stated the amount each country would invest into the Black Project and which military officials would be in charge. It also outlined the purpose of the secretly funded Peace Corps, and stated a number of other policies regarding its activities, which are still classified today. The Peace Corps became active under the designation of:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;Operations Group Echo, Black Ops 9&quot;</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Image80e8.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/sheppard.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/sheppard_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />Brigadier-General Mark Jamison Sheppard</div>

<p>Yet throughout the years, their involvements in matters such as civil wars, coups and other politically sensitive situations began to expose their existence, resulting in the mass media trying to find out who or what this secret organization could be. Some mediums would later on begin twisting O.G.E/B.O.9's actual existence and purpose by saying they were implicated with aliens, Unidentified Flying Objects and the like. Although the UN continued to deny the existence of the organization, hiding the truth with certain matters already leaked out was starting to become increasingly difficult. It would eventually be the ominous operation &quot;Desert Storm&quot; that would officially reveal the existence of Operations Group Echo, Black Ops 9 and their purpose as a specialized international peace enforcing unit.</p>

<p>When the international media discovered that the attempted assassination upon Sadam Hussein by O.G.E/B.O.9 (in a covert effort to prevent the outbreak of the Gulf War) was a complete failure with the resulting deaths of a large number of agents, O.G.E/B.O.9's first contact with the general public was a catastrophe. Nevertheless, it wouldn't be too soon before the UN would be in the press again. This time to officially announce the existence and purpose of the organization and to come together one more time to rewrite the proposal of the late 1950ies.</p>

<p>In accordance with the United Nations Global Defense Act (UNGDA), the &quot;GDI&quot; or fully the &quot;Global Defense Initiative&quot; was founded at the date of October 12th, 1995. The UN proposal stated the following:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;The Global Defense Initiative was founded to enforce the United Nations Global Defense Act and uphold the ideals as outlined in the United Nations Charter.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>Their supreme commander became the American Brigadier-General Mark Jamison Sheppard.</p>

<p>By taking the organization out of the shadows and thus giving the public an insight into its activities and purpose, the speculations and rumors ended and the trust in the UN's peace keeping unit was largely restored.</p>

<h2><a name="td"></a>Tiberian Dawn</h2>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>The media can either be your friend... or your enemy.&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Kane</p></blockquote>

<p>A few years prior to the announcement of the newly formed &quot;Global Defense Initiative&quot; or commonly the GDI, a strange meteor impacted on Earth near the Tiber River in Italy. A scientist by the name of Dr. Moebius found the meteor and discovered that it was the carrier of an alien plant-like life form. Afterwards he took it back to his lab in the United States to have it undergo a series of tests. After several months of research Moebius and his team began to see the inherent danger that this alien plant represented.</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-leftfloating"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/tiberium.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /><br />Tiberium</div>

<p>They would study the plant as it mutated and evolved in the laboratory garden and videotaped what was occurring. Within 14 days of planting the seeds of the Tiberium specimens Moebius had recovered from Italy, it had literally taken over the entire garden.</p>

<p>This shocked the scientists as they began to wonder about Tiberium's origins. But it would be the deaths of some of Dr. Moebius' colleagues that would truly begin to frighten him.</p>

<p>It seemed that Tiberium proved extremely hazardous to humans as it caused horrible health problems as well as causing the intoxicated person to undergo a change in behavior and appearance. It became clear that Tiberium was affecting every known species up to mankind at the genetic level ever since the day of its arrival.</p>

<p>Composed mostly of inorganic material, Tiberium is a non-carbon based substance. Tiberium is extremely toxic, and should not be handled by any carbon-based life form as it genetically alters DNA and mutates the life form it comes into contact with.</p>

<p>However, these extreme downsides can be put into perspective; we do know that the possibilities of Tiberium as a mineral resource are unprecedented. The only places where Tiberium couldn't seem to grow were places without minerals, such as the poles and desert regions.</p>

<p>In the words of Doctor Moebius:</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Imagebd46.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/moebius.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/moebius_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />Dr. Moebius on Science Talk</div>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;Molecularly, it's a non-carbon based element. It appears to have strong ferrous qualities; with non-resonating reversible energy that has a tendency to disrupt carbon based molecular structures. It has unequal positrons orbiting on the 1st, 2nd, and 9th rings. The consequence of this structure is that the possibilities of Tiberium are limitless.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<p>From the research of Dr. Moebius, the following facts were learned about Tiberium and suggests to what its actual derivation might be.</p>

<h2><a name="classes"></a>Tiberium Classes</h2>

<p><strong>Green Common Tiberium:</strong> Green Tiberium is the most common Tiberium. This substance is extremely hazardous to all known carbon based life forms.</p>

<p>Known compositional facts:<br />
- Phosphor 42.50%<br />
- Iron 32.50%<br />
- Calcium 15.20%<br />
- Copper 5.75%<br />
- Silica 2.50%<br />
- Unknown 1.50%</p>

<p><strong>Blue Tiberium:</strong> Blue Tiberium was extremely rare during the first Tiberian War.<br>
It manifests itself in large and often times gigantic crystaline structures.<br>
Its toxic effects are extremely high to all known carbon based life, and when brought into contact with combusting materials it almost behaves as a physical form of anti-matter. This substance is extremely volatile and dangerous and should be handled with intense caution.</p>

<p>Known compositional facts:<br />
- Methane 22%<br />
- Sulfur 19%<br />
- Naphthalene 12%<br />
- Argon 10%<br />
- Isobutene 6%<br />
- Xylene 2%<br />
- Unknown 29%</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;The origins of Tiberium and its actual purpose still remain a mystery to the field of science.&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Dr. Moebius</p></blockquote>

<p>However, by the time Moebius and his team first realized the dangers of Tiberium, the plant was reported to have already spread slowly but steadily over most of the planet. They saw that it might already be too late to warn the world about the dangers of Tiberium.  The shortage in time, however, wasn't Moebius' greatest problem in convincing the authorities to take immediate steps in halting Tiberium growth. Tiberium seemed to absorb all soil nutrition and ground minerals almost like a sponge. The end result of this unique leeching process was the formation of Tiberium crystals, which consisted mainly of a high number of enriched minerals and metals.</p>

<p>Shortly after Moebius made this discovery, an unknown organization suddenly revealed to the international press to have been doing research on Tiberium ever since its arrival and developed a technique of efficiently harvesting these Tiberium crystals with a minimum of mining expense.</p>

<p>Immediately realizing that these harvesting techniques could make the Tiberium crystals into a resource of tremendous economical value, governments and petrochemical companies worldwide attempted to buy off the harvesting techniques from the organization for astronomical prices. Eventually leasing its harvesting equipment to the highest bidders (mainly the G7 nations) on large scales, the organization made sure to maintain its position as a monopolist on the rapidly increasing Tiberium resources, gaining immense financial resources. Within a matter of months, refined Tiberium far outgrew the value of both gold and oil on the world trade markets. The organization that developed the harvesting technology and was therefore directly responsible for this Tiberium gold-fever was a group referring to itself as:</p>

<p style="text-align: center">&quot;The Brotherhood of Nod&quot;</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-leftfloating"><a href="fms/Image7cc6.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/nodharvesting.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/nodharvesting_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />Nod was the world's only supplier of Tiberium Harvesting Technology.</div>

<p>The discovery of Tiberium was literally the dawn of a new era for the entire world. It provided a new source for economic gain and technological development as well as destroying life itself. It would later spread from continent to continent assimilating most organic plant life and sucking up natural resources at an extremely fast rate, moving about an acre every week to two weeks. But unsure about its actual principle and because of its potential, the world welcomed it as if it was diamond. Because Tiberium remained the number one source for economic affluence, the demand for it was always greater than for the concern that some may have on how it is affecting our planet. Moebius' objections to the whole affair of Tiberium harvesting were &quot;taken under advisement&quot; as he was ordered to continue his research on the unprecedented capabilities of Tiberium. In the light of Tiberium's boundless possibilities, the world turned blind to its dangers.</p>

<p>One subject that remained heavily debated nevertheless were the origins of Tiberium.</p>

<p>While the impact of the meteor that carried the first Tiberium specimens was officially deemed a natural occurrence, a number of people including respected scientists theorized that the arrival of Tiberium on Earth was a deliberate act of an intelligent alien species. Following up on this announcement, speculations and theories of all kinds began to go abroad. Some spoke of a hostile act in a bid to weaken our defenses. Others theorized that the aliens were unaware of our existence and sent the Tiberium to Tiberium-form the planet. Some claimed that the Tiberium might even be the alien itself.</p>

<p>Amongst the wild speculation, one group very familiar to the world suddenly reappeared in the media and proclaimed a very different view about the origins of Tiberium and its meaning. It was a sign from the heavens to begin a final and sacred war against the tyranny of the United Nations under the leadership of a living prophet, who was destined by God to lead humanity into a glorious Tiberian future.</p>

<p>This group was the Brotherhood of Nod.<br />
Its prophet was a man called... Kane.</p>

<p>But was the Brotherhood telling the truth of the origins and meanings of Tiberium?</p>

<p>Kane himself claimed that it was the Brotherhood that first discovered Tiberium, and whether through foresight or shear stroke of luck, the evidence speak for itself; the Brotherhood had managed to harvest and process Tiberium, and provide the world with tools to do the same, while Moebius and his team were still beginning to understand the alien substance.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, it wasn't Moebius that named Tiberium; it was Kane. And he didn't name it after the Tiber River near which the meteor had landed, but rather after Tiberius Drusus Caesar.</p>

<h2><a name="bup"></a>&quot;Brotherhood, Unity, Peace&quot;</h2>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;To truly shape the future you must first posses the past.&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Seth</p></blockquote>

<p>With the discovery of Tiberium, the world drastically changed in terms of economics, politics, technology and environment. Many began to perceive the Brotherhood of Nod and thus its strong man Kane as the direct reason for these cultural and technological advancements, even more so than the Tiberium itself. In the eyes of the people the Brotherhood of Nod turned Tiberium from a curse into a blessing, and Nod's popularity and public support worldwide had begun increasing rapidly over the years. However, while the Brotherhood of Nod was welcomed and appreciated by the general public as an upcoming and promising new religion suited to the needs of today's mankind, a number of international intelligence agencies such as Interpol made a disturbing discovery about Nod. Apparently, the Brotherhood of Nod seemed to have close affiliations to a high number of extremist and fundamentalist groups off all kinds around the world.</p>

<p>Because of this, Nod's activities had been closely monitored by the United Nations Security Council ever since they gained the Tiberium harvesting monopoly in the early 1990ies. The Security Council seemed to realize that the connections the Brotherhood had with such a high number of dangerous groups could mean that Nod essentially was trying to gain a strategic foothold in the countries where these organizations were most active or most strongly represented. However, this theory only being a worst case scenario and considering the fact that bringing Nod's dark connections to light would also mean exposing the involvement of American and European weapons manufacturers supplying the arms to these factions, the UN realized it had no choice but to leave Nod's dirty stones unturned. As time went by however, the Security Council monitoring Nod activities began to understand that the theory was slowly but surely becoming reality. It became clear that the Brotherhood's influence on most of the extremist and fundamentalist factions had become so substantial that in effect they were nothing more than Nod splinter groups. Nod slowly began to play a major role in the political and economical fields of most of the countries its splinter groups were active, with among the common people the number of conversions to Nod's religious views increasing day by day.</p>

<p>By the time the United Nations realized what kind of situation the Brotherhood of Nod was setting up it was already too late. UN politicians were shocked to see Kane revealing himself as an absolute political and strategic genius with an ability to sway masses in a way the world had never before seen. Kane began to hold the capitalistic democracy of the UN directly responsible for all of mankind's existing misery, accusing it and its policies from halting the coming of the new Tiberium era to satisfy the corrupt needs of the few regardless the suffering of the many. Particularly in Third World nations but effectively on a global scale as well, Kane's followers started to increase exponentially with people of all nationalities and social standings beginning to worship him as a living messiah destined to lead mankind into a Tiberium future.</p>

<p>As the situation progressed and Kane's abnormal intelligence and charisma became undeniable to the world, high-educated citizens and even political officials began sharing the public feelings and started perceiving Kane as an actual prophet, joining him while offering the Brotherhood all of their personal and professional support.</p>

<p>Realizing that the situation was becoming very serious, UN officials tried anything they could think of to break Kane's immense popularity through trying to involve him in scandals and spreading misinformation about the Brotherhood to the media. When these attempts failed Kane's response to his enemies was unprecedented terror.</p>

<p>Several high-ranking UN officials turned out to be among Kane's followers, keeping him aware of the entire timetable of the UN's anti-Nod propaganda and sending highly classified information regarding military matters and records about the personal lives of UN politicians. Kane periodically released this sensitive information to the media. As soon as one scandal was beginning to be digested by the public, the next one was released.</p>

<p>The consequences for the UN were devastating as they lost credibility and public support everywhere, within certain countries the situation becoming so critical that only the support of the local army was keeping the government in control. Many high placed politicians and military officers were forced to step down, while others began to get involved in car accidents and gas explosions at their homes or were downright assassinated by their own bodyguards or house personnel who were apparently part of Kane's movement as well.</p>

<p>Backed by vast amounts of financial as well as human resources, the Brotherhood of Nod equipped itself into a huge religious army that began to take over the governments of every country where it had enough supporters and annexed them under Kane's single rule.</p>

<p>In a matter of months the Brotherhood had total control of a number of countries on every continent on the world. And when rumors broke out that several Chinese politicians were preparing an alliance with Kane in order to destabilize the strongest western countries, the UN finally decided that the Brotherhood of Nod was to be wiped out immediately.</p>

<p>With Kane no longer being able to hide his own imperialistic tendencies, the UN took immediate advantage of that situation by creating doubt about Kane's true long-term goals among the public of the western nations. Then, on a live worldwide broadcast, the UN declared the man known only as &quot;Kane&quot; to be the greatest danger the free world has ever lived to see, and officially ordered the Global Defense Initiative to liberate the countries Kane annexed by any means necessary.</p>

<h2><a name="firstwar"></a>The First Tiberium War</h2>

<p>As the showdown between the Global Defense Initiative and the Brotherhood of Nod was set into motion, those involved were very aware that should GDI turn out to be unable to halt Nod, nothing will stop Kane from fulfilling his own prophecy.</p>

<p>The dawn of an era and civilization the likes the world has never before known.</p>

<p>The First Tiberian War had begun, and although it didn't rival the materialistic destruction caused by the Great World War II, it ended in a human slaughtering beyond all imagining, turning by far into the most brutal and dirty armed conflict in human history. Looking back on that very history, one thing became very clear. Although Kane did not have the military power at his disposal that Stalin had, Stalin was never nearly the danger Kane was. Where Stalin was a military aggressor bent on conquering land, Kane was a manipulative genius bent on conquering the human spirit.</p>

<p>Kane did not annex countries; he annexed the people in it into his fold. Possessing an abnormal intelligence, he turned the peoples of whole nations against their own democratic rulers, destabilized the military and political systems through their own corruption, through infiltration down to the highest level and sometimes through pure terror. But above all, he proved capable of manipulating the mass media of the world in any way he so desired.</p>

<p>The First Tiberium War had begun, and soon all hell broke loose in Europe and Africa.</p>

<p>The Brotherhood of Nod turned out to be a heavily armed military faction utilizing well-trained and highly fanatical soldiers of all nationalities. Although funded by the G7 nations and thus equipped with high quantities of state-of-the-art weaponry, it soon became clear that GDI was having much more difficulty in controlling the Brotherhood than the UN anticipated. It became obvious that Nod had done advanced research on Tiberium and as the war progressed, they began to retaliate to GDI with never before seen weapons, tactics, and advanced forms of espionage. But although Kane's military power was literally growing by the day, it didn't turn out to be his most powerful weapon.</p>

<p>With the Brotherhood's vast sources of income and followers, they quickly gained support for their cause by advertising factual and non-factual information about the Global Defense Initiative through the press. As he did before with the UN itself, Kane slowly began to ruin GDI's image. Eventually, GDI activities began to be heavily criticized by the masses. Along with his media frenzy, Kane's speeches would enthrall the audiences that he spoke to. He would openly discuss the purpose of Nod and why the Brotherhood was at war with GDI. Kane almost literally controlled the public opinion. To their own horror, the United Nations were forced to realize that they were not capable of standing against the genius of this single mysterious man, as it became very clear that GDI was losing all control over the situation.</p>

<p>Then an event occurred somewhere in eastern Europe that would later reveal itself to be the greatest turn point in the First Tiberium War.</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Image283c.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/burdette.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/burdette_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />Greg Burdette</div>

<p>While European GDI forces were trying to halt the Brotherhood from penetrating into the mid part of Europe through Poland, a number of Nod reinforcements were working their way up north to take control of a town called Beoulistock, which was built on a location of great tactical importance. Realizing that the town would soon turn into a combat zone, GDI managed to arrive first and began evacuating the civilians. A well-known and popular international news reporter by the name of Greg Burdette accompanied them and made a report of the evacuation procedures, with the UN hoping to restore some of the damage Kane caused to GDI's reputation.</p>

<p>When the report was broadcasted several days later, the UN was stunned to find out that Greg Burdette was in fact a member of the Brotherhood, as he stated on live international television that GDI troops had completely slaughtered the population of Beoulistock on the grounds that they suspected the people to be Tiberium smugglers.</p>

<p>The results were disastrous. The public criticism on GDI escalated to street riots and the UN was forced to stop funding the organization and begin a public investigation into its activities and affairs. As the names of GDI officers were made known, so that their actions could be reviewed by the Security Council, many were promptly assassinated by Nod hit men and suicide commandos. As GDI's funding was cut, Kane immediately began launching major offensives all over the world, particularly in Africa. GDI suffered heavy casualties and loss of equipment, while the public inquiries of the Security Council continued undiminished.</p>

<p>What Kane was unaware of however, was that the UN had deliberately faked their withdrawal of GDI support in an attempt to circumvent his watchful eye. This plot worked, as Nod began to stretch their forces thin in order to attack GDI strongholds on a global scale. Because of their over confidence, Nod commanders were completely surprised to find the GDI bases fully operational and heavily fortified.</p>

<p>Most of the Nod attacks were repelled or even completely halted. GDI High Command had been able to outsmart Kane for the first time, and with Nod troops scattered all over the involved regions, GDI struck with full force and new military technology of their own at every poorly defended Nod region in the world. The tactic worked and Nod's war efforts were severely cut back. Then, after two years of harsh fighting which decimated region after region, GDI finally got the break it had been waiting for. Surveillance photos pinpointed Kane's exact whereabouts in a Tiberium research facility in the vicinity of Yugoslavia. Although the reports were not specific, there were rumors that Kane had begun human experiments involving Tiberium, injecting it into human guinea pigs of all ages in an attempt to enhance human DNA and create a next generation of superior soldiers.</p>

<p>The problem was that GDI was short in manpower and equipment for this important mission as their prime directive was to retake all ethnic regions Nod invaded. Therefore, it was decided to send a strike force consisting of elite troops under the command of GDI's finest field commander; an Afro-American officer called James Solomon.</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-leftfloating"><a href="fms/Image449f.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/ioncannon.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/ioncannon_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />Ion Cannon</div>

<p>During this mission, GDI's most advanced weapon was utilized for actual combat for the first time; an orbital weapons platform described as the Ion Cannon. Although this Ion Cannon had a great drawback of requiring a long charging period, it was nevertheless an awesome weapon of great destructive capabilities and impossible to counter or defend against. Through a number of Ionic charges of the satellite-like Ion Cannon, Solomon's task force managed to penetrate the heavily fortified perimeter of the research facility.</p>

<p>What was found inside the facility was never disclosed, but there are a number of reports regarding psychological trauma suffered by the first soldiers who investigated the interior of the facility and found the civilians who were experimented on. Kane was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>With GDI chasing the remaining Nod occupation forces out of most East-European countries, the war entered its final stage. GDI surveillance agents discovered a huge and curiously designed structure in Sarajevo, which the Nod followers called &quot;The Temple of Nod&quot;. This Nod nerve center was soon after confirmed to be Kane's base of operations. But the most terrifying news was that this structure was not only a command center Kane used to coordinate the Brotherhood's global war efforts, but also a facility designed for mass production of NBC weapons (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical).</p>

<p>Although possessing the resources and the technology to use next-generation weapons of mass-destruction ever since the beginning of the war, Kane could not possible have afforded to use them without giving up his most efficient tool: the media. GDI was very aware that now that Kane was losing the battle, he would use this weaponry as soon as it became available while GDI had no intelligence whatsoever regarding their possible targets.</p>

<p>Quick response time became of the utmost importance, so Solomon's strike force was sent to the nearby Sarajevo base to destroy the heart and mind of the Brotherhood of Nod.</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Image5e4d.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/kaneion.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/kaneion_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a></div>

<p>The area was completely locked down by Nod troops, resulting in a clash between Solomon's forces and Kane's private guard that would last almost 72 hours. Then the moment arrived: Kane's last defenses were finally crippled and Solomon ordered to fire the Ion Cannon directly at the Temple of Nod.</p>

<p>Through a hidden camera installed inside by GDI infiltrates, all present in Solomon's command center saw Kane welcoming the blast as he opened up his arms. Fear was not noticed as Kane was seen being vaporized in front of the camera seconds before the temple exploded.</p>

<p>The First Tiberium War was finally over as without Kane's leadership the remaining Brotherhood forces broke in no time. But the haunting image of Kane willingly disappearing inside the Ion beam would loom behind Solomon's mind as he reviewed the tape over and over.</p>

<h2><a name="aftermath"></a>The Aftermath</h2>

<p>As the world learned about the events that took place in Sarajevo, the reactions were very mixed. It soon became clear that several international politicians did not expect that Kane would be stopped and a number of them were conspiring with the Brotherhood to ensure their own place in the new era and civilization Kane was on the verge of creating. However, political leaders and indeed all others who had first hand witnessed or experienced Nod's extreme aggression and violence knew all too well the value of GDI's hard-fought victory, with one of them calling the GDI commanders and troops:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&quot;Heroes to Human History&quot;</p>

<p>When GDI forces began to search through the rubble of the Temple of Nod, they were confused of their findings in a lot of the structural designs as well as not finding any remnants of Kane. Because the Brotherhood used a unique form of architecture in the construction of their bases and temples, the remaining artifacts and schematics were placed in museums across the world. Later massive searches were set up to find any and all remaining soldiers loyal to Kane.</p>

<p>As they continued to search for evidence that could lead to confirmation of Kane's death, GDI military scientists would experiment with new technologies as well as expand on the ones they had. GDI felt that they needed to be prepared the next time they went into war, whether it be Nod or any other hostile force.</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Imagebd55.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/walker.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/walker_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />Experimental Battle Walker</div>

<p>After the war ended, Nod began to divide into smaller factions until the Brotherhood, as a whole was no more. The remaining Nod soldiers and officers went underground and disappeared from sight. Those Nod officials who had been captured were brought before international courts, where they were judged and executed for committing the most profound war crimes on mass-scales or sentenced to life-long imprisonment in mental institutions for proven signs of psychopathic behavior. Although Nod had been defeated, GDI continued to do research with new technologies under the orders of the UN, as to ensure that the Global Defense Initiative is never again caught off guard as it was by Kane.</p>

<p>However, soon other ailments would be in GDI's mind besides Nod and technological achievements. As much as most GDI commanders wanted to focus their attention on assuring the full elimination of the Brotherhood, it became clear that the very thing that provided them with the funds and technology to overcome Kane had now become the world's greatest danger; Tiberium.</p>

<p>With Tiberium beginning to assimilate large portions of Earth's ecosystems, GDI was officially ordered by the UN to begin research and efforts on halting Tiberium growth and evacuating civilians from the most heavily affected regions.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;The possibilities of Tiberium... are limitless...&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Dr. Moebius on Science Talk</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="gdibefore"></a>The Global Defense Initiative: History Before the Tiberian Dawn</h2>

<p>Commonly known as GDI, the organization was first thought of after Great World War II. Because of the great terror the Soviet Union brought over Europe and indirectly over the rest of the world, the United Nations decided to establish a multinational peace keeping force to ensure that no state of world wide emergency would ever be declared again.</p>

<p>GDI originally began as a covert operations group under the designation of &quot;Operations Group Echo, Black Ops 9&quot;, but was not truly active on a large military scale. When the Brotherhood of Nod began invading ethnic regions in the mid 1990'ies, GDI was officially enlisted on October 12, 1995 as an international force to counter Nod aggression.</p>

<p>Other than these facts, no true details on GDI's internal structure or functioning were ever released by the UN, as all statistics regarding GDI's military strength, equipment and personnel are classified to this very day. The official UN statement regarding GDI activities and purpose is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;The Global Defense Initiative was founded to enforce the United Nations Global Defense Act and uphold the ideals as outlined in the United Nations Charter.&quot;</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="gdiafter"></a>The Global Defense Initiative: History After the Tiberian Dawn</h2>

<p>At the end of the First Tiberian War, GDI High Command began a huge crackdown, persecuting all remaining Nod officers and officials to ensure the full elimination of the Brotherhood. What they couldn't have imagined, however, was that this course of action would turn out to be a fatal mistake.</p>

<p>GDI neglected to contain the rapidly spreading Tiberium substance for too long, and the results became disastrous. Not only did Tiberium spread at a much more aggressive and faster rate than anticipated, the initial methods GDI scientists developed to stop the Tiberium growth proved insufficient as well. With GDI concentrating all of their efforts on hunting down the remnants of the Brotherhood Of Nod, Tiberium began to assimilate Earth's primary ecosystems causing vast portions of the planet to become uninhabitable. Soon afterwards, the World Health Organization began to receive strange reports from their field personnel about unknown forms of life, which had been spotted in the vicinity of large Tiberium fields. In addition, humans living close to newly forming Tiberium fields began to show signs of heavy mutation, mutations that were frighteningly enough passed on to their offspring as well.</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Image038e.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/gdicommand.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/gdicommand_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />GDI Command Station Philadelphia</div>

<p>Because the Tiberium assimilation of Earth was occurring at a much faster rate than GDI was able to contain and because it was still unknown whether or not a person suffering from Tiberium poisoning could contaminate a non-affected person, GDI began the construction of a large and highly technological orbital space station known as &quot;The Philadelphia&quot;, to which they immediately relocated their main base of operations along with all their highest ranking officers and best-educated personnel.</p>

<p>On top of that, GDI High Command made the highly unpopular decision not to allow any humans on board the Philadelphia, which were in any way affected with Tiberium poisoning. After the construction of the Philadelphia, GDI began to organize what would become the most massive evacuation procedure in history, relocating vast portions of the world's populations to areas not affected with Tiberium, mainly the polar regions.</p>

<p>The result of these massive relocations was that large portions of land on each continent become completely uninhabited by humans for the first time in hundreds of thousands of years, causing the birth of large &quot;no-man's lands&quot; all over the world. &quot;No-man's lands&quot; of which GDI was very aware that they were ideal places for Nod to hide and reorganize themselves.</p>

<p>GDI later on began setting up small outposts and bases all over these wastelands, not only to monitor potential Nod activity, but also to better research new methods into halting the Tiberium assimilation of Earth as well as to find a way to reverse the effects of Tiberium poisoning and the mutations it causes to human beings.</p>

<p>Rumored to have been founded around 1800 BC, the exact date of its arrival into existence is unknown. The leader of Nod, a mysterious and charismatic man known only as Kane, is considered to be Cain as in the son of Adam by a large number of his followers, but both the UN as well as Nod itself refuse to either confirm or deny those suspicions. Nothing is truly known about Kane's origins or past until his first appearance in the early 1920'ies when Joseph Stalin took control over the Soviet Union, with Kane apparently being his personal advisor.</p>

<p>In being completely aware of all of Stalin's plans and considering his abnormally high intelligence, it is likely that Kane indirectly ran the Soviet Union and was the person directly responsible for the Soviet invasion of Europe. However, when it became clear that the Allies, brilliantly led by General Gunther Von Esling and Colonel Nikos Stavros, began to manage to stand ground against the military power of the invading Soviet Union and started to rally the United Nations against Stalin, Kane realized that Soviet chances were heavily reduced. He disappeared, leaving Stalin to lose to the Allies and apparently planning to resurface when the time was ripe.</p>

<h2><a name="nodconcerning"></a>The Brotherhood: History Concerning the Tiberian Dawn</h2>

<p>The Brotherhood of Nod appeared out of nowhere as a new religion in the early 90'ies.</p>

<p>It started small at first, but under the leadership of Kane and its access to vast amounts of the newly discovered Tiberium, they began to gain power at an explosive pace. Soon realized by its upper level members that Nod was not simply a religious cult but a highly organized fanatics group becoming a massive and high-tech army, many saw it as an opportunity to secure a share of the world for themselves. Nod started taking over small third world and other disenfranchised nations through mass media manipulation, government infiltrations and sometimes through downright military invasions.</p>

<p>Funded by their Tiberium monopoly, supplied by Iraq, China, North Korea and other nations seeing the Brotherhood as a way to strengthen their position on the western nations, Nod built up immense power at a terrifying rate.</p>

<p>To counter this great threat, the United Nations chartered the formation of the Global Defense Initiative, a worldwide defense force originally promised to the world back when the Soviet Union was out to take over Western Europe. Backed with hardware from such UN members as the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Germany, India, South Africa and others, the GDI began to oppose Nod. Surprisingly the war did not go nuclear nor did it go worldwide, but in terms of bloodshed and brutality it absolutely surpassed GWWII on a great many occasions. However, Kane's power didn't simply flow out of military strength alone.</p>

<p>One of the more known and popular reporters of a major television network turned out to be a member of the Brotherhood, giving them access to a vast network of multimedia. Sometime in the middle of the war, Nod broadcasted a number of manipulated news reports regarding a town called Beoulistock which lied in the middle of a GDI-Nod combat zone in eastern Europe.</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-leftfloating"><a href="fms/Image37ab.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/kaneburdette.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/kaneburdette_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />Kane instructs Greg Burdette.</div>

<p>Nod's report claimed that GDI troops arrived and completely slaughtered the town's population. Although GDI forces were actually there to evacuate the civilians, Nod managed to make the general public see otherwise. The UN was forced to halt GDI funding and begin an internal investigation into GDI activities, and at the same time Nod divisions everywhere struck out at GDI troops. GDI suffered heavy casualties and great loss of equipment, especially in Africa, but due to over confidence and poor leadership of Kane's battlefield commanders, Nod troops failed to gain any major leads against GDI throughout the heavy battle, and then GDI themselves began moving in on Nod strongholds after wrenching Nod's Tiberium supply right out of its hands.</p>

<p>Nod began experimenting with Tiberium, seeing how it might affect humans. These experiments were cut short when James Solomon, a GDI commander, destroyed Nod's Tiberium Biological Research Laboratory, acting on orders that made it out to be Kane's stronghold. Then, after GDI Supreme Commander General Sheppard located Nod's true stronghold at Sarajevo, he ordered Solomon to attack the Nod base, using GDI's most advanced weaponry; an orbital weapons platform known as the Ion Cannon, the Mammoth class tanks, and any Nod weaponry they could get a hold of. Solomon personally oversaw the entire 72-hour lasting operation, and the final charge against Kane's Temple.</p>

<p>During the attack, Solomon destroyed the Temple of Nod using the Ion Cannon, not only bringing its existence to public, but also supposedly destroying Kane, the Temple, and the rest of Nod leadership.</p>

<p>That battle marked the end of the First Tiberium War, as Nod factions everywhere began to crumble, and the GDI proved to be supreme.</p>

<h2><a name="nodafter"></a>The Brotherhood: History After the Tiberian Dawn</h2>

<p>The Brotherhood began to fall. GDI forces began a huge crackdown everywhere, and what was left of Nod was dying. With no leadership, no resources and no luck, they would've been gone soon. However, through pursuing the remnants of the Brotherhood so vigorously, GDI made a critical error: they ignored calls to leave Nod alone and contain the Tiberium substance for too long, and it began to consume the Earth, spreading everywhere where there were sufficient materials for it to grow and reproduce, mainly to areas with large plant ecosystems. Only bodies of water, the Sahara Desert, the American Southwest Desert, Siberia, the Australian Outback and the Polar regions were not affected by Tiberium. GDI then was forced to let Nod go about its quiet business, while it was ordered by the UN to get healthy people to unaffected areas as fast as possible.</p>

<p>As GDI was forced to cut back on their persecutions of Nod's remains, the Brotherhood began to recover. However, without Kane's leadership, the unity was broken as Nod began to divide itself into many small and harmless splinter groups. The largest remaining part of these splinter groups came under the leadership of an Egyptian dictatorial-like character named Hassan. Though this Nod splinter group had enough support among the Nod followers to become a new potential threat, GDI managed to keep their influence under control through infiltration, and under-the-table-deals with Hassan himself - cooperation in exchange for covert GDI support, which would help him to stay in power.</p>

<p>There was however one other Nod group, which had silently remained under ground and out of sight of both GDI as well as all the other Nod groups for decades, patiently waiting for something or sometime. This secretive Nod group was encountered once before by GDI forces during the First Tiberium War, however it was thought to be destroyed when its leader, Gideon Raveshaw, was killed by a GDI commando, Nick &quot;Havoc&quot; Parker, formerly of the Dead-6.</p>

<p>Knowing the inner workings of the Brotherhood like none other, this underground Nod group infiltrated the other Nod splinter groups much like GDI had done, keeping the spirit and faith in Kane alive among the followers over the many years, as well as renewing the already existing hatred towards GDI.</p>

<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Imagec572.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/slavik.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/slavik_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a><br />General Anton Slavik, before being saved.</div>

<p>When GDI eventually found out about the continued existence of this silent Nod group and their purpose to ready a new generation of Nod followers and officers, they realized that this group could potentially represent a serious danger to the future of the world. Recognizing the necessity to find and eliminate the leader of this underground Nod group - a man called Anton Slavik, who was an infamous serbian &quot;freedom fighter&quot;, nicknamed &quot;The Serbian Wolf&quot; - GDI General Solomon instructed Hassan to arrest Slavik with the intention to have him put to death under the accusation of being a GDI spy. However, both GDI as well as Hassan underestimated the support and great respect Slavik had among many Nod followers.</p>

<p>Slavik was rescued and freed in the midst of his very execution by his second in command, a woman known as Oxanna Kristos, and disappeared once again from sight. But there was one thing Solomon realized all too well. If this Nod group, currently led by Slavik, had remained silent for decades and now suddenly began preparing the followers of the Brotherhood worldwide for a new conflict, it meant something was about to happen.</p>

<p>Only days later, nearly 30 years after the defeat of the Brotherhood at Sarajevo... Kane reappeared alive and unharmed, not having aged a day.</p>

<p>With Kane's &quot;resurrection&quot; reuniting the entirety of the Brotherhood of Nod splinter groups in less than 24 hours, GDI suddenly found itself in the middle of a nightmare it had almost forgotten about. Now, the future of humanity flows directly into a second Tiberium War, with the Brotherhood Of Nod being as powerful as it has ever been and with the Global Defense Initiative being as prepared as it ever was. While all life on Earth is being assimilated by Tiberium.</p>

<p>Now mankind's darkest hour lurks at the horizon.<br />
Now the world and humanity are under... a Tiberian Sun.</p>

<h2><a name="nodfacts"></a>Known Facts About the Brotherhood of Nod</h2>

Known as &quot;Sha Ae Sheer&quot; or &quot;Path of Nod&quot; among a number of traditional African tribes.</p>

<p><strong>Ideology:</strong> To unite third-world nations under a pseudo-religious political platform with imperialist tendencies. In actuality it is a highly aggressive and popular neo-fascist anti-west movement vying for total domination of the world's peoples and resources.</p>

<p>Operates under the popular mantra &quot;Brotherhood, Unity, Peace&quot;.
The religious viewpoints of the Brotherhood of Nod focus on an alleged Tiberian future for humanity, in which all followers of Kane shall receive &quot;Divination&quot; and flourish in every imaginable aspect.</p>

<p><strong>Current Religious Patriarch:</strong> The Brotherhood of Nod operates under the leadership of a mysterious, charismatic and highly dangerous person known only as &quot;Kane&quot;, whose IQ is believed to be over 196. No forms of civil registration or birth certificates whatsoever have been found about him by neither Interpol nor any other international investigation services. Believed to be a living Messiah and the son of Adam by a great number of his followers, nothing is truly known about Kane's origins or past.</p>

<h2><a name="nodphilosophy"></a>Details About the Brotherhood of Nod Philosophy</h2>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;The Brotherhood had its beginnings with the first downtrodden who looked for a better way.&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Kane</p></blockquote>

<p>The following section contains some of the history of the involvement that the Sha Ae Sheer had in political matters as well as many other things throughout history. Recorded by the scribes of the Godan Tribes, it historically accounts how the Sha Ae Sheer plans to unify the people of Earth under one nation and one rule. This section is also dedicated to proving how the Brotherhood of Nod plans to invoke its philosophy on the world.</p>

<p>The following text is a written recording of a speech Kane addressed to volunteers who wished to join the Brotherhood during the 1990'ies.</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
<p>&quot;Welcome to the Brotherhood of Nod, sometimes referred to as the Ways of Nod or the Sha Ae Sheer. I prefer just the Brotherhood, for that is what we are truly striving for; a brotherhood of mankind, where all can live in peace and share the struggles of life as one.</p>

<p>As long as man has had breath the Brotherhood has existed. For from the beginning - when man's struggle was with nature, not knowing where he might sleep, how he would eat, or whether he would survive to see the light of dawn - there have always been those who would lord over others. People who believe that they, by some unseen right, are granted power over others, and would push others down so they might climb, are the greatest threat to mankind's existence. For many years has one man or one race prospered on the sweat and work of others.</p>

<p>Such injustices are not just a sin against mankind, but also a sin against God. The Brotherhood had its beginnings with the first downtrodden who looked for a better way. These oppressed sought a path that would allow them to gather fruits of life and achieve enough resources and wealth that they and their families could survive and advance with the rest of mankind. Too often have these people been crushed beneath the boot of others, their measly gains stripped from them. Throughout history the &quot;overlords&quot;, often self-appointed rulers, have forcefully taken the resources of those who could not defend themselves.</p>

<p>Whether we consider the pharaohs of Egypt, the Caesars of Rome, the kings of England, or the emperors of China, it was always the blood and sweat of others that created their empires. Today, it is the capitalists of the western nations that are sucking the life out of the rest of the nations of the world. While capitalist barons sit in their mansions, drinking their expensive champagnes, the workers of the world continue to die from starvation and disease. Workers are forced to sleep on the ground without shelter in the sweltering summer heat and may die from frostbite in the depths of winter, their cries for help never heeled by the nation of the western bloc, whose citizens sleep soundly in their beds at night. The imperialism of these nations is even more insidious than that of ancient times.</p>

<p>When the pharaohs and Caesars ruled the realm, at least one knew one's standing at all times. No pretense was ever made that a man or a race was other than what they were. Slaves were slaves; they knew this and expected that they would be treated as such. They were never seduced into believing that they were free men able to achieve what they pleased. It was never suggested that they might be able to do something about their fate and rise above the station into which they had been born. By contrast, the western nations have created a world of slaves without the general populace ever realizing it. Although the so-called free nations claim they are helping to advance the world as a whole, it takes only a moment to see through this pretense and realize that the only ones advancing are the free nations.</p>

<p>With their abundance of resources and technology, the free nations have made economic slaves of the Third World. The disadvantaged Third World countries have had their resources stripped away, education denied, and technology withheld to keep them from threatening the power of the western bloc. And the western nations enslave not only the populace of the Third World, but also many of their own. It is not uncommon to find the squalor characteristic of the Third World right in the heart of all major cities in the supposedly enlightened nations. This lack of caring for one's fellow man, so pervasive in the West, is what causes the Brotherhood to flourish.</p>

<p>The fact that millions upon millions can reach only a poverty-level existence, unable to even feed their own children, is a sin against the nations that cannot be ignored. The Brotherhood has always existed to help those in need. By gathering the resources of our flock and obtaining additional material from our enemy in any manner deemed necessary, the Brotherhood continues to grow and gain power.</p>

<p>We have always been here, behind the scenes, the guiding hand. Empires have fallen by our influence; leaders that could have caused our plans to go awry have silently vanished. The Brotherhood is always in the background, careful to make sure others do not notice our activities. We periodically supply aid to other causes to pull attention away from our true goal. We have slowly and steadily increased our power, but still were never truly able to confront the forces of evil head-on. For thousands of years we have waited for a sign, something or someone that would allow us to mount one last, great Jihad. That sign has come in the form of Tiberium.</p>

<p>With the unstoppable growth of Tiberium across the Globe, most of it occurring in nations friendly to the Brotherhood, our time has come. The vast wealth and resources gained from Tiberium have given us the ability to come into the open and challenge our antagonists face to face. Across the Globe, GDI and Nod forces now clash in a titanic struggle that will decide the fate of mankind for all time.</p>

<p>The GDI hides behind the facade that they are here to help the free nations in their struggle against those they would name terrorist. We in the Brotherhood know the truth. Our fight is for all mankind, not for those cherished few who sit behind desks all day, with no greater worry than whatever it will rain and cancel their tennis dates.</p>

<p>Such uncaring attitudes to the peoples of the Earth can be tolerated no longer. The Brotherhood will unify this world no matter what the cost. Our movement has always striven to be one of peace, but as we all know, the road toward peace is often paved with the blood of those who would prevent peace. The Brotherhood has already taken great strides for global unity. With our advanced technology in Tiberium gathering, we have been able to push GDI forces out of many of the world's nations. The people will follow the Brotherhood - unfortunately, governments do not, and it is the governments that control the armed forces. These self proclaimed governments of the people are using their military forces to keep their populace quelled, to such an extent that the people do not rally to the Brotherhood's banner for fear of repercussions against them and their families. We must show the people that by entering the fold of the Brotherhood they will be safe and taken care of. Their hopes and dreams will be fulfilled only if they place their lives in our care.</p>

<p>Their needs will be taken care of and their families protected - all that is required is that they give of their finances and labor to the Brotherhood. With the guidance of the Brotherhood helping them along the true path, together we will bring the world to a higher state than ever existed before. We will bring about one world, unified, living in peace, and following a single path toward a common goal of equality, all held together by the benevolent supervision provided by me, Kane.</p>

<p>There are many obstacles blocking my path to this magnificent unity; means must be found to surmount these difficulties.</p>

<p>We now come to the addition of you to my fold. The EVA operator interface is the way of the future: combat being directed by a general safe behind friendly lines, but still receiving data of the mission as it occurs. It would take the demented minds of the GDI to come up with a plan like this. How can a man know fear, feel for his comrades, or taste victory in all its sweetness if he sits so far from the battle that the only screams he hears are simulated by a machine? Be that as it may, the EVA system is the best means available to the Brotherhood to ensure our purification of the world.</p>

<p>You have been recruited by the Brotherhood because your views closely mirror our own. Leave behind the dogma of GDI and bring the training and education supplied by them to my cause. We will feed the Tiberium fields with the lifeless bodies of GDI, continuing the struggle until no one and nothing stands in the way of global unification. Your expertise is needed in this glorious struggle. You shall give of yourself body and soul in the service of the Brotherhood, and in return for your efforts you shall become greater than you ever dared imagine. Know your abilities well, but never be satisfied with what you can do today. Strive to surpass today's feats tomorrow and each day thereafter. Do not fail me, for your failure could mean my failure, and I will NOT fail. Up link to your system and lead our forces to splendid victory!&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Kane</p>

<p>Nod's theory on combat is as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;It is more important for us to employ intelligent combined-arms tactics than it is for GDI because it is the Pen that is mightier than the Sword. And we are both the Pen and the Sword when skilled modern armies are commanded by intelligent strategies brought upon by a true military strategist...&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Nod Commander Anton Slavik</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;The Brotherhood exists wherever there is need.&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Kane</p></blockquote>

<p>During a rescue mission, Captain Nick Parker, code named Havoc, retrieved valuable yet disturbing information about certain secret operations handled by the elite cadre of the Brotherhood of Nod, the Black Hand of Nod.</p>

<p>The information Captain Parker recovered along with surveillance video, captured by the Dead-6, which showed three world leading genetics, biology and chemistry experts who were also involved in advanced research into Tiberium at a GDI research center in Guatemala, being led by the Black Hand to an unknown location, suggested Tiberium mutation experiments conducted on civilian population by the Brotherhood of Nod.</p>

<p>The three scientists were Dr. Elena Petrova, a leading, yet somewhat eccentric, geneticist in the high profile Human Genome project. Dr. Ignatio Moebius, a world renowned chemist and the highest authority on Tiberium. And his daughter Dr. Sydney Moebius, a medical doctor highly active in the research of genetic mutations and illness caused by exposure to Tiberium.</p>

<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;Conflict of interests? No. I got interest in conflict.&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Captain Nick &quot;Havoc&quot; Parker</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="grip"></a>The Grip of the Black Hand</h2>



<p>Under the command of Brigadier General Adam Locke, head of GDI Special Operation, Captain Parker was sent in with orders to spearhead the recovery of the three seemingly abducted world leading scientists. However, being the renegade that he is, Havoc went ahead, disregarding orders and reinforcements, to rescue the captured scientists on his own, or at least try to do so...</p>



<p>Following a few leads after the trail of the abducted scientists, Havoc eventually reunited and rescued his old Dead-6 comrades en route to a European Chateau; the then current base of operations for the Black Hand of Nod and its leader, General Gideon Raveshaw.</p>



<p>Havoc then headed into the heavily guarded fortress alone, in pursuit of the scientists. He managed to locate the three scientists only to be held off by Mendoza, a mercenary working for the Black Hand. Killing Mendoza, Havoc was able to rescue one of the three scientists, Dr. Sydney Moebius... And, in the process, turn Raveshaw against his own hired mercenary Sakura Obata, a former... squad member of Havoc's, for failing him.</p>



<p>After having returnined to Locke's command ship, with the help of the Dead-6, and due to lack of concrete intelligence, Sydney offered to help track down her father and Dr. Petrova using the Moebius Suit's detection system, being able to track specific Tiberium radiations.</p>

<h2><a name="evolution"></a>Evolution of Evil</h2>



<p>Reaching the outskirts of a Nod base hidden in the desert mountains, Dr. Sydney Moebius picked up unusual electronic signature... The signatures were those of a Black Hand task force comprised of Ezekiel's Wheel tanks and Ezekiel's Cape forces. Captain Parker was placed in solitary confinement, while the young Dr. Moebius was taken to an undisclosed location.</p>



<p>Havoc was promptly freed by Sakura. Now bent on revenge against General Raveshaw for trying to kill her, she needed Havoc to... serve as a distraction for the Nod forces. Quickly making his way from the prison camp to the Nod research installation, Havoc infiltrated the facility and finally finds the other two missing scientists, Dr. Ignatio Moebius and Dr. Elena Petrova, in an underground Tiberium research laboratory. Two people were locked behind glass doors, like guinea pigs, in that laboratory. Neither of them was Dr. Elena Petrova.</p>



<p>Sakura Obata, using Havoc as a distraction to aid in her plan, managed to infiltrate the underground lab before the GDI officer. Pursuing a vendetta against Raveshaw, she was faced with the newly formed monstrosity of the Re-Genesis produced mutation of General Gideon Raveshaw. No longer a brilliant tactician and fierce leader, but, in the words of Nick Parker: &quot;A walking turnip&quot;.</p>



<p>Sakura tried to take on the mutated Raveshaw. She was defeated and imprisoned in the lab... for future experimentation.</p>



<p>Captain Parker managed to kill... Raveshaw, but he let Dr. Petrova, the now unmasked Nod agent, escape, and with her the location of Sydney Moebius. Freeing Dr. Ignatio Moebius, Havoc returned to Locke's command ship for an evaluation of the situation at hand. In the chaos caused by the fight between Raveshaw and Parker in the lab, Sakura managed to escape.</p>



<h2><a name="holyground"></a>Stomping on Holy Ground</h2>



<p>Upon returning to the GDI command ship, Dr. Moebius was debriefed about Project Re-Genesis.</p>



<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;They're using Tiberium, as a mutagen to incite forced genetic acceleration. Dr. Petrova is attempting to create genetically enhanced super-soldiers.&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Dr. Ignatio Moebius</p></blockquote>



<p>Captain Parker was sent in to Nod's main temple, in Sarajevo, the staging area of Commander Solomon's task force, to infiltrate the temple, learn and recover documents about Project Re-Genesis.</p>



<p>On his route into the temple itself, Havoc encountered various mutations... different stages of human-Tiberian genetic mutation and cybernetic augmentations. Some dumb and cowardly walking vegetables, some cannon fodder and some highly skilled, cybernetically and genetically enhanced elite soldiers, Nod loyalists, willing to undergo the experiments and enhancements of Project Re-Genesis, dubbed Divination.</p>



<p>Havoc also reported about a UFO that was crushed near the temple. Entering that vehicle, showed a very alien environment, albeit an empty alien environment. The vehicle was stripped of contents. And while it might have looked, from the inside, hostile for humans, it seemed more than hospitable to the human Tiberium mutations roaming and guarding it.</p>



<p>Nearing the temple, Captain Parker helped pin point a location for an Ion Canon strike, to cripple the Temple of Nod, instead of outright destroying it. At which time Sakura contacted Parker with a recording of a transmission between Kane and the now &quot;Divine&quot; Dr. Elena Petrova, a transmission during which Petrova makes mention of Dr. Sydney Moebius as the next subject for Divination.</p>



<p>Inside the Temple of Nod, Havoc had to deal with quite a few Black Hand and Kane's Elite Guard squads, not to mention the new cadre of Tiberium enhanced soldiers. On his search for the underground bunker, Havoc came across a few oddities, among them are a new command and control prototype agent, Nod's CABAL, and what Kane claimed to be the tomb, and casket, of his long (very long) time dead brother, the first murder victim, Abel.</p>



<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;Evolve me? No thanks. I like being a cave man.&quot;<br />&nbsp;- Captain Nick &quot;Havoc&quot; Parker</p></blockquote>



<p>On... meeting the Divine Petrova, she to &quot;offered&quot; to evolve Captain Parker, after performing the process on the young doctor. Havoc respectfully declined the offer and proceeded to kill the genetically and cybernetically enhanced Dr. Elena Petrova. After which he released the dazed Sydney and escorted her back to the surface, where Commander Solomon's forces were cleaning things up.</p>


<h2><a name="havoc"></a>Captain Nick &quot;Havoc&quot; Parker</h2>



<p>Who'd have thought a rag-tag townie with a loud mouth and a chip the size of an Orca on his shoulder would come to play a starring role in saving the world? Captain Nick &quot;Havoc&quot; Parker still laughs at the idea to this day.</p>



<p>Parker was that kid... The only child of two exceedingly normal parents (mom was homemaker and full-fledged PTA member; dad a gruff, Allentown steelworker), the young Parker earned his nickname early on.</p>



<p>Branded as &quot;troubled&quot; by school counselors and a &quot;problem child&quot; by neighbors who were worried about the Parker's proficiency at building small explosive devices, he was nonetheless, or rather because of his mischief, revered by the town kids for bringing a little bang - literally - to the dying burg of Allentown.</p>



<p>Parker's youth in Pennsylvania was a gritty collage of fist fights, explosions, after-school detentions, and wry one-liners as a way of coping with it all. Worrisome moms and other community do-gooders often said the &quot;fool boy&quot; would come to a bad end. They would have been right... If the Marine Corps hadn't snatched him up first.</p>



<p>It was in the USMC that Havoc quickly learned to turn his &quot;bad&quot; qualities to his advantage; his gruff attitude and penchant for no-bull action seemed to work in his favor. Most publicly, he wound up heading a Special Forces unit in Operation Desert Storm as part of the USMC's recon team - though that did mean flirting with dishonorable discharge on several occasions. Indeed, Havoc's unconventional methods, while effective enough, often proved a public relations nightmare for the Marine Corps.</p>



<p>The USMC was more than happy to pass him off to the newly formed Global Defense Initiative, where at least the organization's secrecy might work to Havoc's benefit. There, Havoc led the commando squad that would later gel into legend as the Dead-6, officially &quot;killed&quot; to make their covert ops run that much more smoothly.</p>



<p>But not as smoothly as Havoc, or GDI, would have liked. The drawn-out anti-Nod campaign in northern Egypt would eventually result in Havoc's dismissal from the Dead-6. Though no longer officially part of the elite group, Havoc is still a team member in spirit; his brash attitude and rough-handed, but effective, methods are credentials no one can take away.</p>



<h2><a name="dead6"></a>The Dead Six</h2>



<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Imagef881.php?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/dead6.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/dead6_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="109" /></a><br />The Dead-6 Elite Commando Unit</div>



<p>One died in a raid on a terrorist bomb-making lab in southern Chile. Another fell during a bloody conflict while gathering intel on rival Nigerian warlords. Another was assassinated by thugs in the Balkans. Another died in Turkey; another in Australia; another in Jordan.</p>



<p>They're the Dead-6, but they're anything but dead.</p>



<p>Being &quot;officially&quot; killed off, however, was in the best interests of the GDI, which wanted these elite operatives for beyond-covert missions that would hardly benefit from public exposure. Hand-picked after the dissolution of UN peace keeping forces, the Dead-6 were subsumed under the auspices of the GDI, locked in a high-stakes - if not high-profile - war against Nod.</p>



<p>It's hardly a social club; back-pats and high-fives are as rare as mission snafus among this bunch. The Dead-6 is comprised of battle-hardened veterans whose skill in the theater of war seems to compensate for a trouble coping with real life.</p>



<p>Dariel &quot;Deadeye&quot; MacInnis, for instance, is a foul-mouthed Scot who spent many bitter years with the Special Air Service. Today, the expert marksman takes shots for the GDI. Nigel &quot;Gunner&quot; Grant is a rocket soldier who paid his dues in Southeast Asia hot spots - and as a young punk on the streets of South London. Meanwhile, Shai Aviv, nicknamed &quot;Hotwire&quot; for her expertise with electronics hardware, grew up on even meaner streets - those of Jerusalem, where witnessing daily acts of terror inspired a tight-lipped commitment to the GDI cause. Before joining GDI, Eric &quot;Patch&quot; Wulfe perfected his aim as a grenadier while a member of the renowned German counter-terrorist organization GSG9. He finds that explosions seem to be the he international language among this group.</p>



<p>Rounding out the Dead-6 are Havoc, and the slinky, stealthy Sakura Obata, the former Dead-6 member who once shared trench time with Havoc and now works for Nod as the personal bodyguard of Kane's second-in-command, General Gideon Raveshaw. While many Dead-6ers scorn the former Yakuza enforcer as a weak-willed traitor, Havoc can't help but wonder whether he can, in fact, bring Sakura back around to see things his way.</p>



<h2><a name="moebius"></a>Doctor Ignatio Moebius</h2>



<p>Dr. Moebius has the rare of distinction of having risked his life more times than the average GDI commando... And not because the German-born scientist ever set foot on the front lines. Rather, it's because the physicist, geneticist, and chemist is so preoccupied with the far-reaching scientific ramifications of his research that the good Dr. Moebius often forgets that he's dealing with lethal elements. And Tiberium - the most lethal of them all - might be considered Moebius' latest flame.</p>



<p>Fascinated by the mysterious space-born element that can end life or enhance it, Moebius believes that Tiberium will change the world.</p>



<p>Hailed as a child prodigy, Moebius entered college at the ripe age of 11 and received a gentleman's education in Vienna and Paris before developing a love for &quot;hard sciences&quot; such as physics, chemistry and genetics. One of the key directors of the Human Genome Project, Moebius left the HGP amid controversy in the early 1990ies to pursue research into the gene-altering powers of Tiberium. The decision led to widespread condemnation by the world scientific community and the stripping of his Nobel prize; but worst of all, it drew the attention of terrorist groups - among them, Nod - who saw Moebius as a valuable asset for their Tiberium research.</p>



<p>In order to avoid public scrutiny, Moebius was forced to conduct his research underground, funded by private donors - and protected by his main employer, the GDI. Although he's been officially censured by groups such as the influential Global Science Consortium, Moebius is nonetheless regarded in many circles as something of a renegade, even a sort of folk hero. Of course, it could matter less to Moebius, whose fascination with Tiberium - and the controllable mutations it causes - consumes his waking hours.</p>



<h2><a name="sakura"></a>Sakura Obata</h2>



<div class="screenshotbox-leftfloating"><a href="fms/Image6fb5.php?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/sakura.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/sakura_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="109" /></a></div>



<p>Lithe as a lynx and as inscrutable as a Zen riddle, Sakura Obata is a woman with complex motives, extensive skills and with a shady past to rival Kane's. Her latest job - that of personal bodyguard to General Gideon Raveshaw - might come as a surprise to those familiar with Sakura's prior stint for GDI's elite Dead-6 squad.</p>



<p>If you were to ask Sakura herself, the martial artist, acrobat and assassin would likely cross her arms and fix you with an intense stare as if you were the one who had some explaining to do.</p>



<p>As with Kane, rumors must fill in where fact is lacking, and the most widespread one about Sakura concerns her upbringing in the strict, male-dominated environment of the Yakuza, where she learned the deadly trades that make her one of the world's most sought-after assassins. It was also there she learned to sell her loyalty to the highest bidder; and the highest bidder that finally lured her to the United States was the CIA, which was working with the GDI on a covert assignment that would have her sharing trench time with Havoc and the other Dead-6 operatives. The mission: an ill-fated infiltration into a Nod Tiberium processing lab in Siwah, Egypt. It was only after planting the C-4 and watching the lab blossom into a orange ball of flame that Havoc and Sakura got some intel they should have had going in: a high-ranking Libyan official had been visiting the lab, and his death in the explosion sent already-sensitive Egypt-Libya relations reeling with accusations and counter-accusations of assassination plots and conspiracies. Havoc and Sakura were immediately relieved of their duties.</p>



<p>Months later, the GDI officials were left puzzling as Sakura re-emerged as a high-priced Nod bodyguard and assassin. Had her loyalty been bought by the Brotherhood of Nod, or had they owned it from the very beginning? Indeed, some say Sakura's apparent treason wasn't treason at all; some say that Sakura, in Nod's employ all along, had planned the Siwah fiasco in hopes of permanently decommissioning the Brotherhood's biggest threat: Havoc.</p>



<h2><a name="blackhand"></a>General Gideon Raveshaw and the Black Hand of Nod</h2>



<div class="screenshotbox-rightfloating"><a href="fms/Image02d7.html?image=http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/blackhand.jpg"><img src="http://pnmedia.gamespy.com/planetcnc.gamespy.com/features/encyclopedia/blackhand_s.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="109" /></a><br />General Gideon Raveshaw heads The Black Hand of Nod</div>



<p>Every religion has its priesthood, and every military branch its elite. Consider Nod's Black Hand a blend of the two, where battle-bred initiates are inculcated into the religious mysteries that form the core of the Brotherhood's belief system. If this cult-inside-a-cult has its prophet, his name is General Gideon Raveshaw.</p>



<p>Cold, brooding, and speaking in religious maxims when he chooses to speak at all; Raveshaw is in many ways the opposite of Kane. Whereas Kane relishes the opportunity for public speaking and seems to actively seek evidence of faith in Nod members, Raveshaw is an unlikely leader. However, there's a charisma, a method to his coldness, and his savagely brilliant mind make his inner circle the most fanatically loyal of all to the Brotherhood of Nod and Kane.</p>



<p>Originally a mercenary strategist based in Africa, where he would sell his intelligence-gathering services to the highest-bidder, Raveshaw was recruited by Kane to head Nod's specialist branch of spies and saboteurs in order to establish a hub of operations in Tunisia. Given a handful of Nod's best and brightest, Raveshaw undertook a campaign - a mix of terrorist bombings, planted evidence and inflammatory propaganda against the ruling regime - that resulted in a &quot;people's revolution,&quot; i.e., the successful installation of a Nod puppet government.</p>



<p>Like Tiberium itself, Raveshaw exuded some unexpected side effects: he was quickly becoming a cult figure on his own terms. He was soon the unofficial head of the Nod's elite group, where his own style of Brotherhood gospel added yet another dimension to Nod's religious dogma. The official title of Black Hand was derived from a phrase attributed to Kane:</p>



<blockquote class="quote"><p>&quot;When we are crushing the black hearts of our oppressors, we will find our hands blackened. We cannot cultivate our garden without digging in the dirt.&quot;</p></blockquote>



<p>Thus the forces that make up the Black Hand of Nod specialize in Nod's dirty work: assassinations, kidnappings, terrorist acts and other forms of sabotage.</p>



<p>In the Black Hand, the code of behavior is rigid and unforgiving, and discipline is brutal; but every Brotherhood soldier dreams of being initiated into its ranks - where Nod's most pure-hearted are more than happy to get their hands dirty.</p>
